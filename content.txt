As soon as I saw your posting for a part-time help desk representative, I knew it was the perfect position for me. I am the perfect solution for you. Let me explain further:

As you will see from the attached resume, I’ve worn a lot of different hats. I have been everything from a missionary to a chaplain for a small and growing hospice company. Two things have been a constant for me through all of my work. Not only do I enjoy helping people, but also I always seem to be the one guy on the team who is the guy everyone else turned to for help with computers. 

When I worked at the Abilene Reporter News when I was in college in the mid 90’s, I was the only one in the advertising department who knew how to do excel spreadsheets … yes, really. When I was in Africa, I was the only one on my team that knew about social media, or coding html, etc. And in my most recent job with the hospice company, I was the only one in the company, even though I was a chaplain, who knew how to take a spreadsheet of addresses and import them into google maps to make a customized map of our patient census. 

I am known among my colleagues for making well written documentation and understanding the needs of each individual client and responding appropriately. I’m always looking for ways I can add value to the company where I’m working. 

I build strong relationships with other members of my team. I find that humor and empathy help the team cope with the stresses of working through crises.  I am enrolled in an online course where I am sharpening my coding skills. 

I am hoping to find a home in a position where my contributions count and my efforts are appreciated – and hopefully a long-term commitment. The rewarding honor of being able to meet the needs of clients mean just as much as salary to me.
