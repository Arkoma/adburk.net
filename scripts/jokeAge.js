/* An Entry Confirmation Loop

Weâ€™ve learned to prompt the user for their age, and then confirm that their age has been entered correctly. 
Now we can use a while loop to improve the way this works.

Create a while loop that will continue to execute as long as the user has not entered the correct age. 
Inside the loop, provide a confirmation that the age has been entered correctly:

"You entered <age>. Is this correct?"
If that confirmation statement is correct, then set ageIsCorrect to true and alert the following message:

"Great! Your age is logged as <age>."
Otherwise, the loop should continue to prompt a user to enter their age and assign that value to the userAge variable:

"What's your age, user?"
