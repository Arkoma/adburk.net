var numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

numbers [4] calls the value in the variable "numbers"

var passengers = [andrea, aaron, esi, dylan, ozzie]

to call esi you would just type "passengers [2]"

If we wanted to reassign esi's spot to Allyson we would type:

passengers [2] = Allyson

If we type passengers.length we will get 5

If we say passengers.pop(); it will take off the last value in the array and return it to us.  In this case, "ozzie"

passengers.push("Jae") will add 

arrays can hold strings integers and even other arrays

arrays of arrays are sometimes called 2 dimensional arrays.
